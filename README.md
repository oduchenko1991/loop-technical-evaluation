### Important Reminder: Accuracy is Key
We fully encourage the use of AI tools like ChatGPT to assist in completing the evaluation. 
However, it’s essential that you double-check your work for accuracy before submitting. 
While AI can be a helpful resource, errors can slip through if not carefully reviewed.
As part of the role, attention to detail and quality assurance is a must—just like it would be in the position you're applying for.

Please take the extra step to ensure everything is correct before submission. 
This will help save valuable time for both you and our team as we review your work.
Thanks for your understanding, and good luck!

Acceptance Criteria

Objective: Create a Playwright-driven test suite that leverages data-driven techniques to minimize code duplication and improve scalability. 
By driving test scenarios from a JSON object, we can dynamically adapt each test case without repeating code, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure as new cases are added.

Setup and Preparation

Set up a new project or workspace dedicated to this task.

Ensure Playwright and its necessary dependencies are installed and configured.
